This is a page documenting the data management and infrastructure choices throughout the project. 

The Congruence Engine project started with a Data management plan in place as part of the initially submitted to the AHRC project proposal.
As the project evolves and the team grows, new needs, datasets and methods requires new decisions in the area of data management and infrastructure. 
The <a href="https://github.com/Congruence-Engine/documentation/blob/main/data_management/CE_data_storage_tech_infrastructure_strategy01.pdf"> current data management documentation (June 2022)</a> describes the choices the CE team is currently making in terms of management and maintenance of data and resources.
